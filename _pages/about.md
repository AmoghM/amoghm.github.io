<b> Aug '19 - Present</b> 
I have joined the MS in Data Science Program at Columbia University! I feel privileged in studying at one of the best institutes for data science. New York City is amazing! I have been going to meetups, networking events and I am enthralled by the strong data science ecosystem present out here.

<b> Feb '18 - Jul '19
I was working at [Kenome](https://www.kenome.io) in the area of Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Graph under the guidance of Founder/CEO, [Prof. Partha Talukdar](http://talukdar.net/) (IISc). Kenome specialises in utilizing the unstructured enterprise data, dark data, to deliver key insights.

**Fascinating fact**: I was the first full-time employee here!<br> I had an exceptional opportunity to understand the technical and the business intricacies of a startup. Therefore, not only I was involved in building entire data-centric core products but also I was facing the customers. This blend of "product manager + engineer" proved critical for my professional growth.

Areas that I have worked on are: 
* Recommendation Engine
* Relation Extractions
* Entity Extractions
* Knowledge Graphs
* Canonicalization
* Semantic Parsing

When I am not working:
* I am probably creating [tech-tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3rbe5hUTUIAck6j9IwFLGw/playlists?view_as=subscriber_+videos) [topics: Elasticsearch in Python, Machine Learning]
* Playing Cricket or Table Tennis
* Reading research papers

I am a Machine Learning engineer working at [Kenome](https://www.kenome.io) under the guidance of Founder/CEO, [Prof. Partha Talukdar](http://talukdar.net/) (IISc). Currently, I am working in the field of Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Graphs. The journey has been amazing!

**Fascinating fact: I was the first full-time employee here.** This gave me an exceptional opportunity to be involved in constructing an entire data pipeline and deliver finished product. Consequently, I am directly involved in building core products at Kenome. An AI product has numerous components working in tandem and a visibility of this kind at such an early stage of the career has been instrumental to my growth. Areas that I have contributed are: 
* Recommendation Engine
* Relation Extractions
* Entity Extractions
* Knowledge Graphs.

Also, I love to create tutorial videos for the community. They are made with the goal of helping other fellow developers understand the concepts or resolve their issues. Hence, they are kept very short with easy-to-understand script.

In my free time:
* I love to play Cricket and Table Tennis.
* Read research papers and blogs (thanks to fast-paced developments). Yes, I am a geek. :P

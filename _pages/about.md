I am a Machine Learning engineer working at [Kenome](https://www.kenome.io) under the guidance of Founder/CEO, [Prof. Partha Talukdar](http://talukdar.net/) (IISc). Kenome specialises in utilizing the unstructured enterprise data, dark data, to deliver key insights. I have been working in the area of Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning and Knowledge Graphs.

**Fascinating fact**: I was the first full-time employee here!<br>
Since I joined Kenome during its early stages, I had an expectinal opportunity to understand the technical and the business intricacies of a startup. Therefore, not only I was involved in building entire data-centric core products but also I was facing the customers. This blend of "product manager + engineer" proved critical for my professional growth. 

An AI product is comprised of a mix of research and application. Hence, I had an extraordinary advantage of being at the cusp of research and application.

Areas that I have worked are: 
* Recommendation Engine
* Relation Extractions
* Entity Extractions
* Knowledge Graphs
* Canonicalization
* Semantic Parsing


When I am not working:
* I am probably creating [tech-tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3rbe5hUTUIAck6j9IwFLGw/playlists?view_as=subscriber_+videos) [topics: Elasticsearch in Python, Machine Learning]
* Playing Cricket or Table Tennis
* Reading research papers
